this kcontrol module shows the current configuration of the IEEE 1394 bus.
It uses libraw1394 (see www.linux1394.org). I don't know how the 1394 apis
on other OS's look, feel free to port it :-)

The file oui.db is generated from the file oui.txt which you can get at
http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/index.shtml 

It was generated using the following command: 

awk '/base 16/ { if (NF>3) {s=$1; for (i=4; i<=NF; i++) s=s " " $i; print s}}' oui.txt > oui.db
