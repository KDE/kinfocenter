See example/*.

Essentially you place an rc file in the file system that defines the distro logo
and website url. The file ought to be in some XDG_CONFIG_DIRS dir.

Do note that the LogoPath may also be an icon name that gets resolved through
the icon theme. Ideally the logo should be an SVG so as to be scalable for
different screen resolutions.

e.g.
pkexec cp `pwd`/example/kcm-about-distrorc.ex /etc/xdg/kcm-about-distrorc
